C Sharp Two-Week Sprint

This project was using a Code First approach in ASP.NET Framework MVC with Entity Framework. We used Visual Studio 2019 and I worked alongside 3 other students while under the supervision of a project manager and two assistants. I worked 20 hours a week on this project and did a daily meeting each morning to discuss our team's work. Here is the index page, with cshtml and css below:

<img src="./images/IndexPage_cshtml.png" width=750>
<img src="./images/IndexPage_css.png" width=750>



The model, database and CRUD pages were already scaffolded when I was brought in on this project. I styled the navbar, index page, create page, and the edit page, while the delete and details pages are unchanged. The index page also is fully responsive to screen size. I left much of the original scaffolded material, while adding on my own classes and bootstrap to make style changes. I also used a Hashset at the top to allow me to pass in the unique list of titles so that I could group each image together with those sharing a title name with it.



Here is a 50 second video to walk through the entire website functionality:




I have only done a couple drills with EF and Razor pages before coming onto this project, so now I have come to a solid understanding of both and I could be of service to a team using those tools. As I finished the coding bootcamp with The Tech Academy here, I brought together what I learned of computer programming theory and 6 different coding languages and I see the results in my ability to learn quickly and push through frustration to get the job done.

Above all else, I improved my ability to debug and resolve problems, whether related to syntax, page styling, or researching coding methods. And these are certainly the most important skills to have as a developer, along with the desire to finish and resilience in the face of the constant frustration that coding is. 





Dev skills learned:

- Function and styling of cshtml pages with Razor syntax
- Improved debugging using developer tools and inspecting method definition to resolve incorrect implementation
- Understanding of entity framework
- Thorough comprehension of how to properly use Git merging, pulling, updating and pushing of branches.
- Acquired the confidence to think logically like a developer and therefore be able to conceptually plan how to solve problems and think my way through roadblocks



Dev soft skills improved:

- High confidence in smooth communication with team
- Improved ability to frame questions precisely to my team when needing help with my code
-
