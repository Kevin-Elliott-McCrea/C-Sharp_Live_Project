C Sharp Two-Week Sprint

This project was using a Code First approach in ASP.NET Core MVC with EF Core Migration. We used Visual Studio 2019 and worked alongside 3 other students while under the supervision of a project manager and two assistants. I worked 20 hours a week on this project and did a daily meeting each morning to discuss our team's work. My video I attached here shows a walkthrough of the website functionality.

The model, database and CRUD pages were already scaffolded when I was brought in on this project. I styled the navbar, index page, create page, and the edit page, while the delete and details pages are unchanged. The index page also is fully responsive to screen size.



Above all else, I improved my ability to debug and resolve problems, whether related to syntax, page styling, or researching coding methods. And this is certainly the most important skill to have as a developer.




Dev skills learned:

- Function and styling of cshtml pages with Razor syntax
- Improved debugging using developer tools and inspecting method definition to resolve incorrect implementation
- Understanding of entity framework
- Thorough comprehension of how to properly use Git merging, pulling, updating and pushing of branches.



Dev soft skills improved:

- High confidence in smooth communication with team
- Improved ability to frame questions precisely to my team when needing help with my code
-
