# Here is the breakdown of each story I completed on my scrum team

We began the sprint on Monday the 22nd of January. We had the first day to get familiar with the project, then we began on the actual stories. 
We had until Friday the next week to complete our stories.


# Create model and scaffolding

Here I made the model based on the story and added the controller method. 
Then I scaffolded using the code first method and tested to make sure the database and CRUD functionality all worked.

# Make site-wide navbar

I created this partial view, rendered another partial view in it, then I rendered this navbar in the main layout.cshtml page for site-wide content.
I used razor syntax for the render method as well as the action links. I also added bootstrap and my own css to override the bootstrap where I wanted a change.
I grouped the center buttons under one div to center them and the rendered cshtml page buttons in another to align them on the right side.


# Style create and edit pages



# Set up index page to have all db items grouped by title and style index page
